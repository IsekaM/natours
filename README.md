# Natours Project
In this project, I'm building a tour web application, called Natours, using the express framework. First I'll be building the API, then implimenting authenticatoin, configuring the views and, finally, adding a payment gateway as well as some other minor features. 

This project is for practice purposes as I'm following along a Udemy course (Node JS Express, MongoDB & More by Jonas Schmedtmann). I do plan to make it my own in the end or use the knowledge gained from this course to complete other projects that I have in mind.

Stay Tuned for more ðŸ˜‰
